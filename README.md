# CST-corrector

In this project, I used QT Designer to create the interface and Pycharm to programm this app routine.

CST corrector is an automated system to fix CST from SPED files. In an accounting department, an Account Analyst would spend hours if this person had to 
check it transaction in the file and fix it, but using this simple app you can fix it at once and get a new file with the correction. 

This is how the interface looks like:
